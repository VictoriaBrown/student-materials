# Title

## Executive Summary

Web application with the purpose of connecting like-minded students for collaborative projects. The entirety of this document will outline the project as a whole. 

## Business Objectives

This project will be a leap in the right direction for easy collaboration for students. After project completion, students will be able to easily connect with other like-minded students with the goal of working together on a project. The experience of collaborating with others will ensure students have the skill set required for real-world application after they graduate. 

Within this project students will be able to log into the web application and post an idea for a project. Others are able to search and find these posted projects, once they find something they're interested in the two students can connect with a simple button. Once the two students have connected they have the ability to chat over the web application and discuss working together.  

## Background

After graduation, it's found that students have acquired the knowledge that they need in order to find a position in their field. However, many students have reported feeling underprepared in the sense of collaborating with others with the common goal in mind. This project was developed in the hopes of filling that gap.

## Scope

Each student has their own login. Each user has the ability to post a project and search for projects. When searching for a project, users are able to connect with the project poster. Once two users match for a project, a chat is opened where students can discuss more about the project.

This project does not have functionality to continue project development. The sole purpose of this project is connecting two like-minded students so that they have the ability to work together.

## Functional requirements

Login Capabilities: 
The login feature of this project needs to ensure secure logins. 

User Profile: 
Once a user has logged in, the user's profile should automatically be loaded. In this profile screen the user should see their created projects, a Chat button to view Chats with other users, an option to create a project, an Explore button to view recently created projects, and a search bar to search for specific projects. 

Search Projects:
When a user types something into the Search bar, the application will find full and partial matches for posted projects that match keywords entered into Search bar.

Post Projects:
Users have ability to post a project idea. This capability includes a text box for project title, text box for project details, a submit button, and an edit button.

Chat with Matched Students:
These chats are automatically created when two users match on a project. The chat will allow users to discuss project details.
