# Title

## Executive Summary

Web application with the purpose of connecting like-minded students for collaborative projects. The entirety of this document will outline the project as a whole. 

## Business Objectives

This project will be a leap in the right direction for easy collaboration for students. After project completion, students will be able to easily connect with other like-minded students with the goal of working together on a project. The experience of collaborating with others will ensure students have the skill set required for real-world application after they graduate. 

Within this project students will be able to log into the web application and post an idea for a project. Others are able to search and find these posted projects, once they find something they're interested in the two students can connect with a simple button. Once the two students have connected they have the ability to chat over the web application and discuss working together.  

## Background

After graduation, it's found that students have acquired the knowledge that they need in order to find a position in their field. However, many students have reported feeling underprepared in the sense of collaborating with others with the common goal in mind. This project was developed in the hopes of filling that gap.

## Scope

Each student has their own login. Each user has the ability to post a project and search for projects. When searching for a project, users are able to connect with the project poster. Once two users match for a project, a chat is opened where students can discuss more about the project.

This project does not have functionality to continue project development. The sole purpose of this project is connecting two like-minded students so that they have the ability to work together.

## Functional requirements

Login Capabilities: 
The login feature of this project needs to ensure secure logins. 

User Profile: 
Once a user has logged in, the user's profile should automatically be loaded. In this profile screen the user should see their created projects, a Chat button to view Chats with other users, an option to create a project, an Explore button to view recently created projects, and a search bar to search for specific projects. 

Search Projects:
When a user types something into the Search bar, the application will find full and partial matches for posted projects that match keywords entered into Search bar.

Post Projects:
Users have ability to post a project idea. This capability includes a text box for project title, text box for project details, a submit button, and an edit button.

Chat with Matched Students:
These chats are automatically created when two users match on a project. The chat will allow users to discuss project details.

## Personnel requirements

The composition of the team that will be working on this project are the following: four developers, one architect, and two quality assurance testers. This is what is recommended for the project, but with unclear deadline for project completion, this can be renegotiated.


## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*

The delivery of progress whilst developing this project will be separated into different phases. Below shows more detail about each specific phase.

The first phase is to be the Design Phase. During this phase we will achieve an in-depth document outlining the architectual specifications, the user-interface designs, and hardware specifications. At this time, the architect and developers will negotiate the best approach to satisfy the business requirements. A lot of time will be spent cycling back and forth and revising the scope and approach.

After completion of the Design Phase the project will move into Implementation Phase. During this phase is when the actual code for the project will be written. The software team will take the business requirements and specifications and write the code for the web application.

Following the Design Phase is the Verification Phase. The purpose of this phase is to run a series of quality assurance tests to ensure that the project is working as it was designed and that all the business requirements have been met. The team of quality assurance testers will work within this phase. At the very end of this phase is when the final project will be released to the public.

Lastly is the Maintenance Phase. During this phase users will be using the finished web application. As problems are found, changes are made to the project.

## Risks

Every project has its risks. One of the main risks of this project is going to be creating buzz around the project so that students are going to want to use it. We have planned to go around to local colleges and spread the word through bulletin boards about our web project. We also plan on creating a Facebook Page and posting info about it in tech web articles. In order to mitigate this risk, we are going to promote our web app through avenues that are available.
